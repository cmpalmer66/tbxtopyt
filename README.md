# TBX to PYT Translator

This Python toolbox (converttbx.pyt) will take any geoprocessing

# ! WARNING !

THIS IS NOT A 100% AUTOMATED SOLUTION TO CREATING PYTS. You will
need to go in and look over the source before you use it. There
will be areas where you NEED to change the source of the new PYT, 
and others where you'll need to do some sanity checking to make 
sure the PYT's functionality is similar to your original TBX.
